        <h2>🌎 Earth</h2>
        <p>
          Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place
          we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.While Earth is
          only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only
          world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just
          slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four
          planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and
          metal.The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets,
          except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
          However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the
          ground.”

        <h2>🪐 Saturn</h2>

        <p>
          Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet
          in our solar system. Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets,
          Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have
          rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular
          or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn
          is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.

        <h2>🔭 Neptune</h2>

        <p>
          Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the
          eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times
          as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar
          system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by
          mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first
          165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846. NASA's Voyager 2 is the
          only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989
          on its way out of the solar system.

        <h2>☄️ Jupiter</h2>

        <p>
          Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back
          to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons beyond Earth. That
          discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the
          Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more
          than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's
          familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia
          and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s
          iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has
          raged for hundreds of years. One spacecraft – NASA's Juno orbiter – is
          currently exploring this giant world.
